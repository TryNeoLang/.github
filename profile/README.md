# The Neolang Programming Language
We at the Neo-lang team build [Neolang](https://github.com/TryNeoLang/Neolang), a compiled language similar to Python and Rust in structure, however with none of the borrow-checking that Rust uses. 
# Repositories
- Our Programming Language: Neolang is available as TryNeoLang/Neolang
- Our VSCode extension TryNeoLang/NeolangExtension adds Syntax highlighting and Autocompletion to Visual Studio Code.
- Our Neovim plugin, TryNeoLang/neolang.nvim adds Syntax highlighting, LSP and other miscellaneous features to Neovim.
- Demo projects in Neolang are available at TryNeoLang/examples
